# Discord_Openai_Chatbot_Template
Simple openai chatbot and template to create and run it

You'll need to have Python and the discord and openai libraries, as well as asyncio. Use "pip install [package-name]" for these.

This can be done in a virtual environment using the venv command, documentation for which can be found here:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
